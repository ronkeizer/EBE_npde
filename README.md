EBE_npde
========

Aim: Calculate EBE_npde in R

Description: EBEnpde is a diagnostic for mixed-effects models. This R code calculates the EBEnpde based on NONMEM output. 
This is done without the use of PsN. (The current version of PsN doesn't handle inter-occasion variability in a correct way yet.)
